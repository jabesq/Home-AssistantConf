Home Assistant runs on my [Raspberry Pi 3](http://amzn.to/2e3DOBY) with [Aeon Labs Z Wave Stick (GEN 5)](http://amzn.to/2eAiAP0). I've also added a [Rfxcom USB Transceiver](https://www.amazon.fr/Rfxcom-Transceiver-Transmitter-Receiver-Somfy/dp/B01MYFAGWW/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1517229543&sr=8-1&keywords=rfxcom).  The main [SD Card](http://amzn.to/2xeBlgf) was upgraded to 16GB.

**Devices I have :**
* Lots of iOS Devices ([iPads](http://amzn.to/2l2qyRb), iPods, [iPhones](http://amzn.to/2l9Yoq9))
* Nest Protects - Smart Smoke Detectors - [Blog Post](http://www.vmwareinfo.com/2017/06/psa-check-out-your-smoke-detectors-once.html)
* Phillips Hue Hub Gen 2
* Mixture of Hue Colored lights, White Lights.
* 3 Hue Go](http://amzn.to/2iB36Ii) - Great lights for the kids since they have an actual button on them for control.
